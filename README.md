## Task 1: Setting up your site

### Step 1
Create a new repo on github using the template [here](https://github.com/boysbrigade/bb-template)  
Name the repo as your github username `.github.io`  
For example my github username is `nathanwoodburn` so my repo name would be `nathanwoodburn.github.io` (https://github.com/nathanwoodburn/nathanwoodburn.github.io)  

### Step 2
Go to the settings tab of your repo and the Pages section.
Set the Source to `Deploy from a branch` and the branch to `main`.
Click save and wait for the site to build.

### Step 3
Verify that your site is working by going to `https://<your username>.github.io`  
(For example https://nathanwoodburn.github.io [this will redirect as I have set a custom domain name])

## Task 2: Updating your site content
While you are on the main page of your repo, press the `.` (period) key on your keyboard.  
This will open the repo in VSCode in your browser and allow you to edit the files in the repo.  
After you save the file, you will be able to commit the changes.

## Task 3: Commiting your changes
1. Click the `Source Control` icon on the left hand side of the screen (looks like a branch)
2. Enter a commit message in the box at the top of the screen (use a good commit message)
3. Click `Commit and Push` to save the changes in a commit.
4. Wait for the website to be updated (this may take a few minutes and you can check the progress in the `Actions` tab of your repo or the tick/orange dot next to the commit)

## Task 4: *Optional* adding a custom domain
This task is optional and will require you to choose a domain name.  
You can pick anything ending in `.boysbrigade.au` (For example `nathan.boysbrigade.au`)  
You will need to get Nathan to add the domain to the DNS records. (Ask him on discord/email)
